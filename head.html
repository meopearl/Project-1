            <img src="selfstudy.jpg" alt="Self Study" class="education-photo">
            <p>During my three-month internship at a printing company, I engaged in a self-educational journey that significantly enhanced my design skills. Immersed in a fast-paced environment, I quickly learned the importance of understanding printing processes and techniques. This hands-on experience allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world projects, bridging the gap between classroom learning and practical application.

                Working closely with experienced designers, I gained insights into effective design practices and the nuances of client communication. I developed a keen eye for detail, learning how to create designs that are not only visually appealing but also suitable for various printing methods. This internship taught me the significance of color management, typography, and layout, which are crucial for producing high-quality prints.
                
                Moreover, I embraced feedback as a vital tool for growth, refining my designs through constructive criticism. Overall, this internship not only improved my technical abilities but also boosted my confidence as a designer, equipping me with essential skills for my future career in the design industry.</p>
